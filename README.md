## Running-Track

An application to set your running goals, enter the details of your runs and automatically display your goal progress.

## Application Description/Objective

Set your monthly running goals, enter the details of your planned and completed runs and automatically track your progress. View other users runs and clap each other for motivation! Access your runs on the go, no need for notepads or spreadsheets. It's easy to use, secure and free.

## Background

The application is aimed at novice runners and runners that do not want GPS tracking or detailed statistics, but are simply aiming to complete a target number of monthly runs. The application is simple to use and will help runners stay motivated and develop a running habit.

## Getting Started

Log in using Google OAuth to create your account. Create some monthly running goals and enter the details of your planned and completed runs. You can edit and delete your goals and runs if necessary.
